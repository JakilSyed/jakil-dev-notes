1. Changes in Switch condition
-- Break statement can be removed now.
-- To do so we need to use -> instead of : after case. With this there is no need of break.
-- Switch expression is introduced.
we can assign value returned from switch cases. like below

//Java 14
        String day = "mon";
        String time = "";
        time = switch (day) {
            case "sat", "sun" -> "7am";
            case "mon" -> "8am";
            default -> "6am";
        };

        System.out.println("time for days is" + time);
			
-- If we dont want to use arror ("->") after case and want to stick to old ":" syntax then we need to use yeild keyword to return the data.
below is the example with yield
String day = "mon";
String time = "";
time = switch(day) {
			case "sat" , "sun" : yield "7am";
			case "mon" : yield "8am";
			default : yield "6am";
			};
			
			
2. Local variable type -> "var" 
-- Introduced in Java10.
-- Must be initialized

3. Triple quote String to write multi line string.
//Java 15 feature

String name = """
Jakil
Syed
""";

4. String Template. 
//Java 21 feature
-- STR is introduced


5. Sealed Classes
-- if we write final then no other class can extend that class.
-- With "sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Bike" the allows mentioned class for extending

sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Bike {
	public void go() {
	}
}


6. record classes
-- it will reduce number of lines in code. All methods like getters, equals, hashcode, parameterized constructor are included
-- all variables are private final
-- Setter are not included. Hence record class is immutable classes. its used only in Data transfer use cases
-- record class cannot extend another class as it already extends record class internally. But we can implement interfaces
-- record Vehicle (int id, String name) {}
